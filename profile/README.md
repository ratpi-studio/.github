# Ratpi Studio

🎮 **Ratpi Studio** is an independent non-profit focused on creating original video games and creative tools.
Our goal: bring to life fun and meaningful projects through a hands-on, open, and inclusive approach.
We believe everyone should have access to quality creative tools and games — that’s why we’re committed to providing **free and open alternatives** to expensive, inaccessible software. Everything we build is, and always will be, **free for everyone**.
